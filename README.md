# MIDI-Player-Roblox
A collection of roblox sounds from many different sources to bring full midi file emulation to roblox. Offset is the amount of pitch to tune the instrument correctly, Gain is an addition/subtraction of volume for dynamics, Loop is to loop the sound or not, and just ignore color ig. A perfectly good example of using ToneJS can be found in X32Gex5's repository (https://github.com/arm8086/rsc-scripts/blob/main/midiPlayer.lua).

NOTES: For drum kits the midi key is not a pitch but a different instrument, make sure to implement this. Also use the PitchFinder.lua file to convert the midi note into a roblox pitch. Use https://tonejs.github.io/Midi/ for converting a midi file to a json table and then read the keys. midi = midi note, instrument = the instrument in the big table, and velocity is volume for dynamics.

THIS REPOSITORY WILL UPDATE WHEN I FIND NEW INSTRUMENTS

Thank you GameHero, Youngmacka, WomanMalder and X32Gex5.
